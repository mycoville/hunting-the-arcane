# Hunting the Arcane
Hunting the Arcane: A "single-stick" shooter game for mobile devices: Combines elements from modern technology and fantasy settings. Built with Unity.

# In this version:
* A new enemy type: A wizard that shoots energy balls at you! Be careful, they do a lot of damage!
* Minor damage receiving bugfixes: Now the player should never be infinitely damaged in case the enemy dies the very moment the player receives damage. Probably created new bugs too, though :D
* Minor function placement adjustments (made some damage functions easier to access).

# Unity info
Made with Unity version 2019.3.7f1

# Noteworthy
* Graphics and sounds are quickly-made placeholders.
* No true map design or generation yet: I have not decided whether I want to generate the maps via code or design each of them and make them larger.
* Some powerups might feel non-impactful, but this is intended as you would collect several of them in one playing session.
