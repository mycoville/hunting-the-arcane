# Hunting the Arcane
Hunting the Arcane: A "single-stick" shooter game for mobile devices: Combines elements from modern technology and fantasy settings. Built with Unity.

# Unity info
Made with Unity version 2019.3.7f1

# Noteworthy
* Graphics and sounds are placeholders.
* No true map design or generation yet: I have not decided whether I want to generate the maps via code or design each of them and make them larger.
* Some powerups might feel non-impactful, but this is intended as you would collect several of them in one playing session.
